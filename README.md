# GuessingGame

## Description
This is a simple Java guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess the number. The program gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also counts the number of attempts and provides a rating based on how quickly the correct guess is made.
